# Portfolio

Hi there! My name is Fernando Herrera. I'm a 100% mexican made Biomedical Engineer, born and raised in the city of Monterrey, Mexico. I have a passion for exploring topics about health, physics and music. This portfolio encapsulates that passion and showcases my journey in the field of data analytics and data science, through a collection of projects which have let me develop technical and analytical skills such as data manipulation and visualization, critical thinking and problem solving, but most of all, **perseverance**. There is whole world of information available to everyone, and learning how to learn from that information and how to transform challenges into growth opportunities is something everybody should invest in mastering, regardless their field of expertise!

## Projects

### EEG Classification: Animals and Objects

> During this project, the EEG dataset of 15 male subjects was extracted, visualized 
> and pre-processed to attempt obtaining an accurate binary classification neural network
> using Pytorch, predicting wether a subject is identifying the picture of an animal or of 
> an object.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
